On Stocks, I wanted to have two different two stocks. I wanted to see the relationship between them. Are they move along with each other. If one stock goes up, does other moves int the same way? Do they drop same way? Same Day? can you predict one stock based upon another stock's movement?
I wanted to find out if volumes that get traded on both stocks have the similar movement?
